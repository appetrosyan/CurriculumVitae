\opening{Dear Gattaca}
Given that you have asked a few questions related to my past
experience I have taken the opportunity to provide you with a more
guided tour of my corpus of work.

Currently I am a full time distributed systems consultant for Eclipse
Laboratories Inc., but it may be more beneficial to think of me as a
founding protocol engineer. The business-to-business arrangement was
simpler.

With that out of the way, allow me to address the questions that you
have posed in the description.

\textbf{The most exceptional} project that I have worked on is without
a doubt \href{https://hyperledger.org/use/iroha/}{Hyperledger
  Iroha}. I was in charge of the largest engineering team in
Soramitsu, consisting 9 protocol engineers, 2 front-end developers, 2
QA engineers, 1 DevOps and two technical writers, not counting
external interactions with other teams.  Save for a few components,
the design was left largely up to me, from the block format, its
on-disk storage, things like the introduction of state Merkelisation,
and other features, under the design constraints of deadlines, and
collaborations with other projects, specifically the Fraud
Intelligence Blockchain and the CSD-RTGS linkages proof-of-concept,
which was to demonstrate the viability of Iroha version 2, in the
CBDC/cross-border-transaction context.

The implementation largely was up to me; the team that I mentioned,
with the exception of three persons was assembled by me, and included
a large amount of junior engineers, whom I was tasked with bringing up
to the necessary proficiency.

While I have many anecdotes, one that stands out is an example of how
I was tasked with improving the performance of our consensus algorithm
so that the throughput of the ledger could be raised from $2$ TPS to
$2000$. The first step was understanding why the ledger was slow: I
employed multiple tactics, the one that proved effective was usage of
causal profiling using \texttt{coz}. It provided valuable insights
into the cause of the problem: there were successive calls to
asynchronous functions in Rust that resulted in thread starvation. To
fix this, one would need to preserve the consensus algorithm, but also
inline much of the logic. As such I gathered a task force of people
with talents specifically suited to optimisation. By that time there
were two looming deadlines, we had to provide a long-term support
version, as well as base our work on cross-border delivery versus
payment off of the branch that demonstrated the improved
performance. There were problems with the implementation. The program
no longer scaled down to single-threaded containers, and
deadlocked. The solution required a good amount of extra work, but
work that was done well, and was commended by the CEO of
Soramitsu. The CSD-RTGS linkages project went as planned and resulted
in a grand presentation of which I was a part of.

Honourable mentions would be the Solar Eclipse, which is a fork of
Solana used in the Eclipse main network, only given a backseat because
it is (for the moment) closed source. I would probably give it a bit
more limelight, because of its relevance to MEV, based on the Jito
patch-set Additionally, I should probably mention \texttt{supernest},
which has been the basis of two released papers, and one in the works,
though not relevant to our discussion today as it is neither written
in Rust, nor interesting to blockchains.

\vfill

\textbf{The reason why I'm looking for a new oppportunity} is simply
that I am looking for a new challenge.  The Eclipse main network is
nearing completion, and while there is plenty of engineering work to
be done, to quote the late great Leonardo DaVinci, ``a mind rusts with
disuse''.  I have always found it helpful to be aware of new
developments. 

\vfill

\textbf{This begs the question of why \textit{Gattaca}}.  Aside from
the name, and minimalist website, the promise of a challenge and an
opportunity to delve into a new problem space, I would probably cite
the fact that you are looking through this letter. I appreciate
companies with a personal touch.

As a closing statement, I'd like to provide you with references:
Ry~Jones(\href{mailto:ry@linux.com}{ry@linux.com}) is the senior
architect at Hyperledger, and the person I've had the most intensive
interactions with. Dr~William Handley
(\href{mailto:wh260@cam.ac.uk}{wh260@cam.ac.uk}) is my academic
supervisor and frequent collaborator.

\closing{Sincerely}
