  I'm a Physicist who works as a Tech Lead at Hyperledger, a
  subsidiary of the Linux Foundation, currently leading the
  development and design of Hyperledger Iroha, the world's first
  parallel blockchain ledger.  I graduated with an MSci from the
  University of Cambridge in 2020, with many successful projects under
  my belt.  I've ranked near the top in both my Masters' (accelerated
  nested sampling\cite{cpi}), and Bachelor's (charge fractionalisation in
  Polyacetylene\cite{charge-frac}) theses. I've studied many areas of Physics,
  particularly Quantum Condensed Matter Physics, Quantum Information
  Theory, General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory, theoretical,
  experimental and computational.  During the Quantum Condensed Matter
  Physics examination I chose and excelled at the Density Functional
  Theory questions.  After graduation I combined full-time employment
  with theoretical research, resulting in my first first-author
  publication: Relativistic Langevin equation derived from a
  particle-bath Lagrangian\cite{langev}, as well as ongoing work on
  \texttt{Supernest}\cite{sspr}.

\section*{Work Experience} {%
  \setlength{\parindent}{0in}%

  \job{Sep 2021}{Pres.} {Soramitsu}{Tech Lead} {I am a (senior) Rust
    software engineer, tech lead and product owner of the project.  I
    organised and designed the processes of the timed release cadence
    of Iroha v2. I have the highest number of commits to the project.
    I assembled the team that is considered the best in the company,
    and produced the first Long-term support release candidate of
    Iroha 2\footnote{Pre-release but reliable enough for testing on
      production systems}. I've reduced the number of known bugs to
    zero\footnote{Excluding UI/UX issues}, designed four out of five
    headlining features of Iroha 2 (implemented two), been a reliable
    leader and the face of Hyperledger Iroha in all public-facing
    events. More-less sole Maintainer of Hyperledger Ursa since July
    2022. Nominated to the Hyperledger Technical Oversight
    Committee. }

  \job{Oct 2020}{Sep 2021} {PolyChord} {Software
    engineer} { Expanded upon and built the package \term{supernest},
    which accelerates Bayesian inference by a factor of 1000. Worked
    on Likelihood-free inference, parameter speed hierarchy ---
    functional programming correspondence. Work was presented at the
    MaxEnt 2022 conference in Paris (publication accepted).  }

  \job{Jul 2020}{Oct 2020} {Cambridge DAMTP} {QA intern} {Designed a
    neural network for vetting the applicability of the NHSx X-ray
    data for automated diagnosis of COVID-19, which was comparable in
    precision, but required 5--6 times less processing power.  }

  \job{Jul 2018}{Oct 2018} {Cambridge University Computer Lab}
  {Software Development Intern} {Designed, and improved a dynamic road
    network All-pairs shortest path solver, using a highly
    paralleliseable graph traversal framework, which improved
    performance by a factor of 50.  }

  \job{Jan 2013}{May 2015}
  {Masterlagebra.org} {Backend Developer} {Designed and implemented
    problems for university level automated linear algebra training
    program. Problems were related to complex numbers, Gram-Schmidt
    ortho-normalisation process, analytical geometry problems
    involving planes and lines in higher dimensions.  }

  {Physical Natural Sciences Tripos} {Took courses in Relativistic
    Astrophysics and Cosmology as well as Quantum Field theory read by
    the Department of Mathematics. One of the top results in my
    Research project on ``Accelerated Nested Sampling in context of
    Cosmological Parameter estimation''. My optimisations lead to an
    improvement of Nested Sampling's performance by a factor of 30. }

  {University of Cambridge} {BA \nth{2}}{Physical Natural Sciences
    Tripos} {Received the Cambridge Trust scholarship. Formal training
    in Functional Programming and OOP.\@ Took optional courses in
    Theoretical Physics. \nth{1} class in Research Review on the topic
    of ``Charge Fractionalisation in Poly-acetylene''. Was forced to
    intermit for a year due to mandatory millitary service in my home
    country of Armenia. }
