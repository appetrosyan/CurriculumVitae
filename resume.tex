  I'm a recent MSci Graduate from the University of Cambridge, with a
  keen interest in Theoretical Physics. My primary interest are in
  relativistic statistical mechanics, and non-equilibrium
  phenomena. My recent work on the
  subject~\cite{petrosyan2021relativistic}, explored the implications
  of Lorentz covariance on a classic derivation of the Langevin
  equation, and its implications for causality in fully stochastic
  systems. Additionally, I have been working with my former Masters'
  supervisor Dr William Handley at his startup â€“ PolyChord, for the
  past two years. I have a good solid background in Bayesian
  inference, and in fact my master's thesis was on accelerating nested
  sampling\cite{cpi}. I have a publication in the works for the
  Journal of OpenSource Software\cite{sspr-joss} detailing the fruits
  of my labours: \texttt{supernest}.

 \section*{Work}
 {\setlength{\parindent}{0in}
   \job{Jun 2020} {present}{PolyChord}
   {Data Scientist}{ I designed \texttt{supernest} a method of
     accelerating Bayesian inference by nested sampling dependent on
     the covariance structure of the model.  For cosmological
     likelihood \texttt{supernest} can produce an uplift of $3\times$
     the performance with an \emph{improvement in accuracy} by a
     factor of \(1000\times\). When precision normalised, the
     effective speedup seen in the average case scenario is
     \(600\times\).  }

     Astrophysics and Cosmology as well as Quantum Field theory read
     by the Department of Mathematics. One of the top results in my
     Research project on ``Accelerated Nested Sampling in context of
     Cosmological Parameter estimation''. My optimisations lead to an
     improvement of Nested Sampling's effective performance by a
     factor of 30. (I further refined it into \texttt{supernest},
     which produced an even greater performance uplift)}

\section*{Soft Skills}

\job{2015}{2017}{Queens' College} {Technical director} {I supervised a
  self-motivated team of volunteers to set up and dismantle
  decorations at the Queens' College Fitzpatrick Hall, as well as
  handle Audio visual equiment including but not limited to ROBE
  colorspots, human sized speakers, trusses, stage hydraulics, a laser
  projector and multiple smoke machines. 

\textbf{Skills}
\begin{itemize}
\item Orgsanisation
\item Team management
\item Resourcefulness
\item Responsibility
\item Time management
\end{itemize}

On QErgs 2016 (which is the largest indoors rowing competition in the
world), we had a large issue. The Ergs (devices which measured the
sportspeople's performance) were located at the far side of
Fitzpatrick hall, right under the projector screen and opposite the
projector. They had to be connected to the projector via a CAT6
shielded wire, that eventually lost signal. Instead of panicking, I
quickly made a skype call with desktop sharing to the Wi-Fi connected
laptop at the far side and resumed the event. }
