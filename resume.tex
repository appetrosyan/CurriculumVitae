\renewcommand{\coverletter} { I'm a Masters' Graduate from the
  University of Cambridge with a keen interest in astrophysics,
  High-energy physics and Cosmology. I have had a productive career
  both at the University of Cambridge, with my research projects
  producing some of the top results, as well as at the
  Russian-Armenian Slavonic University, where I contributed to
  several internal research papers.  }
