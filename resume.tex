  I'm a recent MSci graduate from the University of Cambridge, with a
  keen interest in Theoretical and computational cosmology.  I have a
  knack for finding patterns and diligently pushing through complex
  calculations. On several occasions I have found simpler, more
  elegant solutions to problems, resulting, in the case of my Masters'
  thesis \texttt{supernest}~\cite{sspr-joss}, in a performance gain by
  a factor of 30, and a precision gain by a factor of 1000 at the same
  time. I also have a keen interest in looking at interactions between
  Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Physics and the Theory of
  Relativity~\cite{langev}. In my Latest work, I have attempted to
  create a Lorentz-covariant form of the Langevin equation and derived
  the reliativistic equivalent of the fluctuation-dissipation
  theorem. I sincerely wish that under Prof. Ferreira's supervision I
  shall be able to contribute to modern scientific discourse
  productively and usefully.
