#+Title: A C.V. Template for LaTeX
* Motivation

  I have seen a couple of cases when people have generated their C.V's using LaTeX. I have found that althought this is a common occurrence, nobody has actually standardised an approach. So I decided to step in and do my part. 
* How it works. 

  As of now, this is just a .cls file that defines a few standard functions. The appearance is fixed but I plan to implement more options later. 
* How to use it. 

  Put the Curriculumvitae.cls into the root of a folder, and use 

  =\documentclass{Curriculumvitae}=

  in your .tex file. 

  My =resume.tex= should serve as an example. You are free to add sections and more types of fields using the =\bipart= macro. 
* Planned features. 

- More than one layout. 
- Options to control the overall appearance. 
- Scripts to auto-generate a C.V. based on a job tag.
