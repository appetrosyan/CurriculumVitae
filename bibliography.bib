  abstract =	 {We present a method for improving the performance of
                  nested sampling as well as its accuracy. Building on
                  previous work we show that posterior repartitioning
                  may be used to reduce the amount of time nested
                  sampling spends in compressing from prior to
                  posterior if a suitable ``proposal'' distribution is
                  supplied. We showcase this on a cosmological example
                  with a Gaussian posterior, and release the code as
                  an LGPL licensed, extensible Python package
                  supernest.},
